# ImageSearch

SwipeToSpin Programming Test (Swift)

Write an iOS app, using Swift. The app should allow the user to search
for images and display the results by specifying the following:
1. What to search for (e.g, cat, dogs, iOS Coding Challenges, etc.)
2. The maximum number of images to fetch â€” prime numbers only*.
You are free to use any free online service to fetch the images (e.g.,

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-
image-search-api/).

* If the value entered is prime, allow the user to proceed with the
search. If the input value is not an integer greater than one, or is not
prime, display a helpful error message. The error message should
state which conditions were not met (Invalid Input, Not Prime, or
both).
